   <h2><center>Deforestation</center></h2>
      <div align="center" style="width:600px; margin:auto;font-size:20px">“For every tree
         you cut down, plant three more.” Cutting down trees has been a major concern.
         Multiple species suffer due to deforestation. Forests make up 30% of land, 
         and studies show that in 100 years, there will be no trees left. Trees
         are needed for animals like monkeys that live in trees. Losing trees means losing
         monkeys. In addition, the carbon dioxide that we breathe out, and the carbon
         emissions that we create, are all consumed by trees.</div><br>

      <h2><center>Air Pollution</center></h2>
      <div align="center" style="width:600px; margin:auto;font-size:20px">
         Air pollution is endangering our own species, as well as many others.
         Factories produce carbon emissions, which get released into the air. 
         Breathing in the polluted air will shorten life by 1-2 years. Diesel
         trucks also contribute a lot to air pollution. Even at the Grand Canyon,
         tourists can not see to the other side due to air pollution, and smog. In
         smog it is safe to put on a mask that covers the mouth and nose.</div>
