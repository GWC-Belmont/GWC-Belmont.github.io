   <h2><center>Deforestation</center></h2>
      <div align="center" style="width:500px">“For every tree you cut down, plant three more.” Cutting down trees has been a
         major concern. Multiple species suffer due to deforestation. Forests make up 30%
         of land, and studies show that in 100 years, there will be no trees left. Trees
         are needed for animals like monkeys that live in trees. Losing trees means losing
         monkeys. In addition, the carbon dioxide that we breathe out, and the carbon
         emissions that we create, are all consumed by trees.</div>
