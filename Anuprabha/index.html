   <h2><center>Deforestation</center></h2> 
      <div align="center" style="width:600px; margin:auto;font-size:20px">“For every tree
         you cut down, plant three more.” Cutting down trees has been a major concern.
         Multiple species suffer due to deforestation. Forests make up 30% of land, 
         and studies show that in 100 years, there will be no trees left. Trees
         are needed for animals like monkeys that live in trees. Losing trees means losing
         monkeys. In addition, the carbon dioxide that we breathe out, and the carbon
         emissions that we create, are all consumed by trees.</div>

      <h2><center>Air Pollution</center></h2>
      <div align="center" style="width:600px; margin:auto;font-size:20px">
         Air pollution is endangering our own species, as well as many others.
         Factories produce carbon emissions, which get released into the air. 
         Breathing in the polluted air will shorten life by 1-2 years. Diesel
         trucks also contribute a lot to air pollution. Even at the Grand Canyon,
         tourists can not see to the other side due to air pollution, and smog. In
         smog it is safe to put on a mask that covers the mouth and nose.</div>
    <h2><center>Water Pollution</center></h2>
    <div align="center" style="width:600px; margin:auto;font-size:20px">
       Did you know that 70% of the earth is water, and that only 2.5% is
       fresh? The Dakota pipeline runs through a Native American reserve 
       in North Dakota. Since the state is landlocked, most of the freshwater
       is groundwater. If the pipeline bursts, the groundwater will be contaminated. 
       In some places, groundwater is already inedible. For example, groundwater in 
       Bangladesh is contaminated with arsenic. Arsenic is very toxic, acute poison 
       and a carcinogen. Approximately 85% of the total area of Bangladesh has contaminated 
       groundwater.</div>
    <div align="center" style="width:600px; margin:auto;font-size:20px">The lithosphere(geosphere),
       hydrosphere, atmosphere, and biosphere are the four main systems on earth. These “spheres” 
       rely on each other. In other words, if one is altered, it affects all the others. For example,
       when Mount St. Helens erupted, the geosphere was affected because the top of the volcano blew off.
       The atmosphere because, 540 million tons of volcanic ash polluted the air. A nearby river got
       polluted by a dust avalanche (hydrosphere), and finally the biosphere was affected because 
       thousands of plants and animals were killed, and visibility was reduced.</div>
