   <h2><center>Deforestation</center></h2>
      <p>“For every tree you cut down, plant three more.” Cutting down trees has been a<br> 
         major concern. Multiple species suffer due to deforestation. Forests make up 30%<br>
         of land, and studies show that in 100 years, there will be no trees left. Trees<br> 
         are needed for animals like monkeys that live in trees. Losing trees means losing<br>
         monkeys. In addition, the carbon dioxide that we breathe out, and the carbon<br>  
         emissions that we create, are all consumed by trees.</p>
