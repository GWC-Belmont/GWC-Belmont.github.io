    <h2> Ones you won't want to go to</h2>

  <p> This restauarant called Lolo's eatery is very sketchy. There are no windows, the bathrooms don't have doors, there are tiles stolen from the floor, there's only one floor with 6 employees and only <em>half</em> of them are working. The food is mediocre, their pizza has so much grease it becomes soggy. Any meat is either undercooked/raw or overcooked/burnt, and they don"t have fruit or vegetables, so yeah don't go<p>
