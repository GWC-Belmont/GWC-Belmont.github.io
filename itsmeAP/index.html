    <h2> Ones you won't want to go to</h2>

  <p> This restauarant called Lolo's eatery is very sketchy. There are <strong>no windows, the bathrooms don't have doors, there are tiles stolen from the floor, </strong>there's only one floor with 6 employees and only <em>half</em> of them actually work. The food is mediocre, their pizza has so much grease it becomes soggy. Any meat is either undercooked/raw or overcooked/burnt, and they don"t have fruit or vegetables, so yeah don't go<p>
      
 <h3> What is Walkie talkie and why you shouldn't go there
   
   <p> Walkie talkie is this buffet style restaurant in the center. No one wants to clean or wear hairnets, so make of that what you will. The food is so-so, better than Lolo's but that doesn't say much. There have been reports of brawls and riots over better pricing, since their stuff is expensive for no reason. Their notorious dish is the Krabby sub at $22. They took inspiration from the Krusty Krab's Krabby patty except with their signature sauce and in sub form. Burnt usually, other times soggy, the texture is repulsive. It feels like a hockey puck and looks like one too. The sauce is faint, since it usually is covered by a thick burnt taste. But what I could taste of the sauce is sour, too much soy sauce and salt. It tastes like the bottom of the ocean biting into it. They used to serve fries, but it was so terribe with their green sauce it was discontinued. So in conclusion, please don't go, save yourself.</p>

   <h4> What is the butter cafe and why it's a health hazard</h4>
   
   <p> Butter cafe is exactly what it says it is; butter and lots of it. Not just sticks of butter but foods using a lot of butter. They're quite tasteless, actually. Although fat provides most if not all of the flavor in foods, too much of it obviously isn't good for one's health. There have been reports of dirty butter, overdue butter, and people choking on the butter in the restaurant due to excessive use. The owner is currently tried in court for misuse of buisness and mistreatment of customers. At least 100 people who visited the store prior are filing complaints or lawsuits. There is bread made with sticks of butter with butter stuffed inside the bread with butter on top, gross. The restaurant reeks of butter and their mascot is some weird smiling stick of butter flailing outside. That'll totally rack in customers.</p>
