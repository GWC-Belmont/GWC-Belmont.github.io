    <h2> Ones you won't want to go to</h2>

  <p> This restauarant called Lolo's eatery is very sketchy. There are <strong>no windows, the bathrooms don't have doors, there are tiles stolen from the floor, </strong>there's only one floor with 6 employees and only <em>half</em> of them actually work. The food is mediocre, their pizza has so much grease it becomes soggy. Any meat is either undercooked/raw or overcooked/burnt, and they don"t have fruit or vegetables, so yeah don't go</p>
      
 
    <h3> What is Walkie talkie and why you shouldn't go there
   
   <p> Walkie talkie is this buffet style restaurant in the center. No one wants to clean or wear hairnets, so make of that what you will. The food is so-so, better than Lolo's but that doesn't say much. There have been reports of brawls and riots over better pricing, since their stuff is expensive for no reason. Their notorious dish is the Krabby sub at $22. They took inspiration from the Krusty Krab's Krabby patty except with their signature sauce and in sub form. Burnt usually, other times soggy, the texture is repulsive. It feels like a hockey puck and looks like one too. The sauce is faint, since it usually is covered by a thick burnt taste. But what I could taste of the sauce is sour, too much soy sauce and salt. It tastes like the bottom of the ocean biting into it. They used to serve fries, but it was so terribe with their green sauce it was discontinued. So in conclusion, please don't go, save yourself.</p>

   
   <h4> What is the butter cafe and why it's a health hazard</h4>
   
   <p> Butter cafe is exactly what it says it is; butter and lots of it. Not just sticks of butter but foods using a lot of butter. They're quite tasteless, actually. Although fat provides most if not all of the flavor in foods, too much of it obviously isn't good for one's health. There have been reports of dirty butter, overdue butter, and people choking on the butter in the restaurant due to excessive use. The owner is currently tried in court for misuse of buisness and mistreatment of customers. At least 100 people who visited the store prior are filing complaints or lawsuits. There is bread made with sticks of butter with butter stuffed inside the bread with butter on top, gross. The restaurant reeks of butter and their mascot is some weird smiling stick of butter flailing outside. That'll totally rack in customers.</p>

      <h5> How Y.G is the worst place you've ever eaten or seen in your <em>whole</em> life
        
        <p> I personally don't know how someone could even make a place like this. I should've had a warning in the beginning saying that I'll be biased, but you get it, right? Okay, anyways, this place has the worst customer service, food, ambience, look and mascot you will probably ever see. First of all, customer service, if I can even call it that.<em>Nonexistant</em>, I tell you. I understand that you don't want to work there, and you even showing up is out of desperation. But if I come there for food, give me food! If I spend my hard earned money to go to your crappy place you better give me something. See, I went twice. I know what you're thinking, "Why did you go twice if you hate it so much?". First time I was by myself, someone suggested it to me. The second time a friend asked me to go with them and I couldn't get out of it. So, the first time, there were only ten people and the employees were twice that, but I didn't get my food until two hours after I got there, and I was the second one who ordered. Everyone ordered the same crappy thing; a soggy beef sandwich with tasteless black beans that are undercooked. It should not take that long, because everything is frozen, so frankly all they have to do is heat it up in a freaking microwave. That's how five star they are. So, when I finally get my food, the girl dropped the plate on the table. <strong>DROPPED.</strong> So half of the disgustiong food was on the floor, and boy was I mad. Usually, I'd ask them to make me another one, but I don't think I want that in this case. I came with a friend a week after and <em>no one</em> picked the mess up. There's bugs and rodents all over the place and mold on the walls. When I asked an employee about that, he's like, "Do you want to clean it" in a very stern, sarcastic voice. That's not my job, sir, I was about to say, but there's no point. So yeah, it was a flipping nightmare</p>
  
        <p> Now, onto its look and mascot. The walls are torn, I kid you not. It looks like it shouldn't be a restaurant, or anything at all. The wood was chipped. They do have a sign on the wall saying "Y.G, the place to be" but it looks like grafitti on a back alley wall, <em>so</em> sketchy.
