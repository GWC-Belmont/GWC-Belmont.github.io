    <h2> Ones you won't want to go to</h2>

  <p> This restauarant called Lolo's eatery is very sketchy. There are <strong>no windows, the bathrooms don't have doors, there are tiles stolen from the floor, </strong>there's only one floor with 6 employees and only <em>half</em> of them actually work. The food is mediocre, their pizza has so much grease it becomes soggy. Any meat is either undercooked/raw or overcooked/burnt, and they don"t have fruit or vegetables, so yeah don't go</p>
      
 
    <h3> What is Walkie talkie and why you shouldn't go there
   
   <p> Walkie talkie is this buffet style restaurant in the center. No one wants to clean or wear hairnets, so make of that what you will. The food is so-so, better than Lolo's but that doesn't say much. There have been reports of brawls and riots over better pricing, since their stuff is expensive for no reason. Their notorious dish is the Krabby sub at $22. They took inspiration from the Krusty Krab's Krabby patty except with their signature sauce and in sub form. Burnt usually, other times soggy, the texture is repulsive. It feels like a hockey puck and looks like one too. The sauce is faint, since it usually is covered by a thick burnt taste. But what I could taste of the sauce is sour, too much soy sauce and salt. It tastes like the bottom of the ocean biting into it. They used to serve fries, but it was so terribe with their green sauce it was discontinued. So in conclusion, please don't go, save yourself.</p>

   
   <h4> What is the butter cafe and why it's a health hazard</h4>
   
   <p> Butter cafe is exactly what it says it is; butter and lots of it. Not just sticks of butter but foods using a lot of butter. They're quite tasteless, actually. Although fat provides most if not all of the flavor in foods, too much of it obviously isn't good for one's health. There have been reports of dirty butter, overdue butter, and people choking on the butter in the restaurant due to excessive use. The owner is currently tried in court for misuse of buisness and mistreatment of customers. At least 100 people who visited the store prior are filing complaints or lawsuits. There is bread made with sticks of butter with butter stuffed inside the bread with butter on top, gross. The restaurant reeks of butter and their mascot is some weird smiling stick of butter flailing outside. That'll totally rack in customers.</p>

      <h5> How Y.G is the worst place you've ever eaten or seen in your <em>whole</em> life
        
        <p> I personally don't know how someone could even make a place like this. I should've had a warning in the beginning saying that I'll be biased, but you get it, right? Okay, anyways, this place has the worst customer service, food, ambience, look and mascot you will probably ever see. First of all, customer service, if I can even call it that.<em>Nonexistant</em>, I tell you. I understand that you don't want to work there, and you even showing up is out of desperation. But if I come there for food, give me food! If I spend my hard earned money to go to your crappy place you better give me something. See, I went twice. I know what you're thinking, "Why did you go twice if you hate it so much?". First time I was by myself, someone suggested it to me. The second time a friend asked me to go with them and I couldn't get out of it. So, the first time, there were only ten people and the employees were twice that, but I didn't get my food until two hours after I got there, and I was the second one who ordered. Everyone ordered the same crappy thing; a soggy beef sandwich with tasteless black beans that are undercooked. It should not take that long, because everything is frozen, so frankly all they have to do is heat it up in a freaking microwave. That's how five star they are. So, when I finally get my food, the girl dropped the plate on the table. <strong>DROPPED.</strong> So half of the disgustiong food was on the floor, and boy was I mad. Usually, I'd ask them to make me another one, but I don't think I want that in this case. I came with a friend a week after and <em>no one</em> picked the mess up. There's bugs and rodents all over the place and mold on the walls. When I asked an employee about that, he's like, "Do you want to clean it" in a very stern, sarcastic voice. That's not my job, sir, I was about to say, but there's no point. So yeah, it was a flipping nightmare</p>
  
        <p> Now, onto its look and mascot. The walls are torn, I kid you not. It looks like it shouldn't be a restaurant, or anything at all. The wood was chipped. They do have a sign on the wall saying "Y.G, the place to be" but it looks like grafitti on a back alley wall, <em>so</em> sketchy. 
        <h6> Halo's is ridiculous, don't go</h6>
        
        <p> I honestly don't get why the place is a place and not a jail cafe. The funny thing is, practically no one goes here. I just go because to some extent it"s amusing how terrible the service and the food and the look is. I went there 4 times, I'll take you through the last time I went so bare with me</p>
        <p> Imagine walking into a dusty, rusty, falling apart type building that belongs in that basement no one cleans. There's lint <em> everywhere</em>, so I didn't even have to say no one goes there the place speaks for itself. Anyway, you walk in, take your seat because no one greets you and reservations don't exist. You try to adjust your chair and look around to get a good view of the place, not much to look at besides a foggy window (not actually foggy, it just hasn't been clean so you can't see anything except the sun) and a dangling piece of plastic that's supposed to be a chandelier. So, your chair creeks, the table gets wabbly when you start moving it and you realize you have to use the bathroom. You go, and this is no exaggeration, into a dark hallway that's the kind of place slenderman would catch people in, and you walk down that hall until you get to some door. The door is also creeky, the lights are dim going inside, and honestly the bathroom is the best part of the place. It's not that clean, but it stills looks much neater than the rest of the place. There are stains on the toilet that cannot be wiped off, but that's minor details. So anyway, you're done with that and you actually want to eat some food so you take a menu from the front podium. Mind you no one is there, they're all in the back making food or yelling at each other. The menu looks kind of hopeful, even though most of them you know are hard to actually make in real life</p>
        <p> So, you decide (like I did) to get one of the more ambitious dishes on the menu, the raviolloi with sauteed crab and other vegetables with their "special sauce". I think you'll learn not to really trust "special sauces". They are either okay but you find out you're allergic to one of the ingredients or terrible and you realize they screwed up your favorite ingredients. So, on each table (there are 10), there is one bell you ring to show that you are ready to order. So you order, and someone from the very back of the place shows up and takes your order. They leave and you're alone again. It actually doesn't take super long for the food to come like other restaurants, it can take sometimes <em>too</em> quickly which concerns me just as much. So the food arrives on your plate with untensils and water refills and you take a bite. You realize that the raviolli is frozen, like, actually frozen as if they didn't even bother to cook it they just taken it out of the freezer, put it on a plate and gave it to you. The crab is burnt black and the vegetables are super hard, not crunchy satisfying hard, like rock can't even digest it hard. And don't even get me started on their "special sauce". First of all, it's pink. Not a color you'd want on your plate, maybe for dessert but not sauce. It has specles of orange in it, which contains cinnamon, but that doesn't look tasty at all. The taste is horrific though. It has so many flavors that don't go well together or even alone some of them. For example, cinnamon, paprika and lime is what's in the orange mix, and if you taste it your taste buds will get confused as all heck. </p>
        <p> It also has onion puree with fish oil that smells so bad and it's all over the food. Like I said, taste buds will be confused because there's so many ingrediants that taste like polar opposites and together they just taste like something you'd want to throw up. Super salty, super bitter, tries to be savory but fails, an odd sweetness in the back of your mouth, and the ingrerdiants I mentioned is not even half of them. You gag and want to get that foul taste out of your mouth so you order dessert. Everything sounds good and you realize like I did that the place looks good on the outside, or on the way down however, but then you start to lose faith and everything turns to crap. But unfortunately, that taste <em>needs</em> to get out of your mouth so you get fudge cake.</p>
        <p> Your fudge cake comes, bites into it and you bite into dust because they probably dropped the cake on the way to the oven, that happens often. Also, the cake's fudge has no flavor. It tastes like absolutely nothing and it feels like you took a bite into mud, even that would have more flavor. You ring the bell to file a complaint even though you know in the back of your mind that they don't get paid enough to listen to what you have to say but you say it anyway. They sluggishly walk towards you and asks, "May I help you" and you ask why there is lint in your cake, etc. They never give straight answers, if they even decide to answer you, so they just say they'll ask their manager and they don't come back. They don't even care if you don't pay because they probably know the food and the service is crap, and besides, they don't even go through the door that the customers go through when coming to work. So they can completely avoid going to the dining area, isn't that great? I mean, they do that anyway, but that's besides the point. So yeah, that's the grand experience.</p> 
        
        <h7> Why Kay Kole is terrible and what it is <h/7>
          
          <p> Now, Kay Kole is named after the owner. This is an important detail because she's a jerk, you'll find out why later. To prove a point, I'm going to tell you what it was <em>supposed</em> to looked like. You walk in a room, there's people greeting you at the door, handing you a menu with a smile (funny). Upstairs is a winery, so you go downstairs to where the dining is. The stairs are supposed to have marble flooring with ivory handles, that won't make a sound on the way down (also funny). You go down to more people greeting you, and you take a seat at what is supposed to be a nice, non creeking table with cloth draped around it. The owner/manager isn't present during hours, because they <em>should</em> have better things to do. You order, there aren't too many people there so you get your stuff at a good time (not too late, not super early). You eat, it's good, you enjoy some music, pay your check, and you leave. Unfortunately, this place kinda sucks so you won't find that here.</p>
        
          <p> The only true thing that came out of that is the winery. The wine is probably used to take the terrible taste of the food out of the person's mouth. The owner greets you at the door, but the menus are downstairs becuase they always forget to give them to people. And the word "greet" is taken very lightly because Kay is just like, "Hey, welcome to Kay Kole's. I'm Kay Kole let me lead you downstairs, I hope you have a great time" in a very monotonous voice. It sounds like it's scripted, because she's usually fake anyway. Also I have to note this; first of all, she won't lead you downstairs. She doesn't even care if you fall down the stairs, she just wants the wine. All she does is use this cross walk signal that tells you to go, that's how lazy she is. Second, she doesn't care what kind of time you have there, good or bad, she just wants you to pay her. And you'll find out, there's a literal tip <em> jar</em>, like she expects you to think the service is good. Talking about her, she's a goldigger, hotheaded, creep.</p>
          
          <p> She shouldn't even be there, she should be checking more on the people who are supposed to be working but aren't. She knows that no one cleans but does nothing about it. She rested her head on the bar table and there was a bunch of freaking <strong>mold</strong> on it! What did she do? She looked around, wiped her face with her hand, and left, like, the entire place to probably go drinking next door. So one day, I asked her why there was a giant wad of moldy gum under my chair and table and the wall for christsake, she said, "Oh, that? It's very clean, my people did a very great job" as she nodded. Are you serious? What do you mean, was she actually serious? I looked at her as if she was insane, she's so oblivious to how bad she and the place is it's terrible. So she's like, "Why? Do you have a problem with the way we run our business? Because I could escort you out if you want" she started to get louder. I mean, who's going to escort me out? She has no security, and I'm just trying telling "her people" to clean the freaking place, it's a mess and that doesn't do well for health inspectors, I'm surprised they haven't been closed yet. There mice on the floor, there was even a possom once because they let the back door open. They could afford replacements for literally everything they have because they cheat money from the customers, yet they won't get an AC. Her people are some of the smartest people I ever met, like wow. </p>
         
          <p> So that's just one example where she was a jerk, even though there are <em> so</em> many. In addition, when I say they cheat customers of their money and that Kay's a golddigger, they make everything expensive, over $20-30 expensive. One of their dishes is $60, for no reason. It's not much different than all of the other dishes. So going down, it's old wood that creeks after every step. When you finally get down, there's a few people who probably been waiting for their food about an hour now. You sit down, the table is wood and very dusty and noisy. No cloth covering it.
